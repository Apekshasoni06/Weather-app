# Weather-app
The project is a web-based weather application that allows users to check the current weather conditions for a specific city. 
Users can input the name of a city, and the application fetches real-time weather data using the OpenWeatherMap API. The displayed information typically includes temperature in Celsius, weather description (e.g., sunny, rainy), humidity percentage, and wind speed in meters per second. 
This simple and user-friendly application provides users with up-to-date weather details for their chosen location, helping them plan their activities accordingly.
